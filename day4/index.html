    <h1>Day 4</h1>
    <p>
	"Shared Tears"
</br>
Sometimes we shed a tear alone, sometimes together, sometimes separately.
</br>
I thought I'd look at how a teardrop can combine or stay separate.
</br>
This can happen at borders within an individual, within a family, within a global community. The latter is exemplified by the biggest loss of life of our time with perhaps 200,000 or more young soldiers dea in the Russian-Ukranian war. 
</br>I had to add salt to help snap a photo of the drips more easily. The shared tear can actually form a bridge between the knives, I saw this but I wasn't able to capture it in my 60minute slot.
