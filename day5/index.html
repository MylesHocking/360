    <h1>Day 5</h1>
    <p>
	"360 Expressions"
</br>
I envisaged a website that contains my daily art meditations
</br>
I thought no better expression of 360 than a circle, each segment being clickable. It felt like something unique and odd you'd see in the early days of the internet when people were experimenting more. You've seen the results on the main page. I attach a happy accident I made when I got the Cos and Sin equations wrong, giving rise to these wings.
</br>
I enjoyed getting my hands on code. Messy and mediocre as I am. Playing around with Github, css, html, javascript, and SVG has been it's own little creative reward. This took a couple of days worth of hours!
