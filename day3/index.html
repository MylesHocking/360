    <h1>Day 3</h1>
    <p>
	A triad for day 3</br>
      Mother - Father - Child
</br>
Inspired by a LinkedIn rant post about childcare costs and lots of discussion about 'economics' there was zero mentions in over a hundred comments about the most important thing: that is a child is loved. Raising excellent humans is essential. Nurseries and other high-cortisol environments are sub-optimal, but that doesn't seem something that gets much acknowledgement on LinkedIn, why would it? It's the system lauding the system.

I am trying to keep these to 60minutes, so I went to copy the mum and flip it to edit to a dad and actually doesn't matter if it's two females, whatever, the bonds of love and protecting the infant from the less than benevolent forces of society is what counts.
