    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Myles and I'm making human-generated art for 360 days as a luddite reaction against AGI.</BR>
	  
The liberal arts weren't part of my school and uni, so everything will fall into "keep your dayjob!" territory but here goes Day1:
</BR>
The Point.
</BR>
Only the single, central point is pure white, the rest fades to four pure black points on each corner. As Derrida says about words, their definition also derives from their contrast against other words, so pure light is contrast here.
